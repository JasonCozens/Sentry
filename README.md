# Sentry
A system to watch and display log messsages.

This project was inspired by https://sentinel.codeplex.com/

Unfortunately when looking at sentinel source it didn't appear to be developed using TDD.

So the purpose of Sentry is to build a log monitoring and analysis system using TDD and at the same time use this a a teaching resource.
